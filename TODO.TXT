for beta something
** Make Gamma Race to replace Cave Race
** Ask Megaman for Sonic CD permission (If I even still have that)
** Finish Pesky Kids (and give it a new name since it's not about windows anymore)
** Pester Rozark later for City Escape

for final release:
** add a hub where people vote on maps
** add a hard mode, set by a cvar and alters maps (like force beams on generic lava)
** add a title / credit map and update credits
** finish the 8 remaining maps and see how the others do

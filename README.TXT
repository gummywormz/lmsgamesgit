Changelog:

PB1 - v0c:
LMS13's GutsManG cannot hit you while on the elevator.
LMS11 now has a 10 second wait before beginning. If this doesn't fix the lag
I'll have to scrap it.
LMS09 no longer breaks with only 2 players sometimes. Missile speed fixed.
LMS10's skeleton joes no longer stay active forever.
LMS14's ballade cracker now gives an accurate description of what it does.
LMS14 now has a way of dealing with campers.
LMS07's conductor role is clear.

v0b - v0b2
LMS01 takes your buster away. I don't know if it still breaks though...
LMS04 / LMS11 size reduced. This should fix the lag for low quality servers.
LMS05 and LMS10 have round end invulnerability for the winner.
No more random crushing in LMS10.
Quick beams should no longer stay forever in LMS10.
No more team killing in LMS07.
Health of reactors buffed in LMS07.
LMS13 has 3 more time bonuses.


v0a - v0b:
LMS01 has been replaced with a map that works.
LMS04's rings respawn correctly. The hudmessage for how many rings you need is
now per player instead of global.
The giant telly is forced to spawn and got a slight buff.
Clearinventory works now because I killed the randomization scripts.
LMS05's hudmessage regarding how many items you have is aligned properly.
LMS05's items now have +FLOORHUGGER so they don't bounce on respawn.

//will be done later. This exists just so I remember to credit peoples.
